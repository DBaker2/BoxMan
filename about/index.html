    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">What's Google Cardboard, and how do I get one?</div>
      <div class="answer"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> is Google's awesomely inexpensive approach to virtual reality. You can either purchase one for around $15 or make your own and buy lenses. Everything you need to know is on their website.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">I've got everything set up, but I can't get the box to stay centered on my head. How'd you manage that?</div>
      <div class="answer">Be creative! We just cut a circular hole in the underflaps and then kind of fold the flaps up into the neck once the box is around your head.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">I don't have any friends. Can I still play?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yep! You can replace Camera Guy with a stationary laptop or desktop computer(Apple products included), or you can even be both Camera Guy and Box Man at the same time. You can experiment with making yourself feel taller or shorter by holding up the camera over your head or at your waist. Or try something new!</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">I keep fogging up the lenses and my phone screen. How can I avoid that?</div>
      <div class="answer">We've found that tucking a bandana under the Cardboard and above your nose is one way to avoid this issue. The bandana can also double as a way to block light from getting in from below.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Why are Apple mobile products not supported?</div>
      <div class="answer">Last we checked, iOS browsers did not support WebRTC, which Box Man makes use of. There is a browser called Bowser that does support webRTC, but Bowser doesn't support MediaStreamTrack, which is also needed. If you have found a workaround, please let us know and we would be happy to extend the experience to iPhone people.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Do I need to be connected to WiFi?</div>
      <div class="answer">No! Not any more! A strong WiFi connection may, however, yield lower latency and higher quality streaming. <span class="strike">We have not yet configured Box Man to be played on the 4G/LTE network, but we are working on that. Box Man can and will break these cuffs.</span> Boxman has broken these cuffs.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">What browser should I use?</div>
      <div class="answer">We've done all our testing on Google Chrome, but it should also work on Opera and Firefox. Who knows about Internet Explorer. Make sure your browser is updated to a relatively new version.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Can I wear glasses or contacts while being Box Man?</div>
      <div class="answer">Sure, although if you are myopic, you won't need them. We aren't sure about hyperopic folks, so let us know if you try it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Is this going to burn through all my data for the month and leave me unconnected and helpless?</div>
      <div class="answer">No, it shouldn't. It definitely won't be an issue when you're on WiFi. We are going to do a thorough data consumptino report soon.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Help! I've followed all the directions and it isn't working!</div>
      <div class="answer"><a href="https://github.com/DBaker2/boxman/issues">Here is list of known bugs and issues.</a> The simplest thing to try is to open it up again in a new tab/window and make sure you are using a sufficiently unique name.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">Where can I find the source code?</div>
      <div class="answer">Check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DBaker2/boxman.git">Github repo</a>.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">The box seems superfluous. Do I really need to wear it?</div>
      <div class="answer">Uhhhh...do you wanna be cool?</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">What <span class="hNote" data-note="sic">is</span> Brains and Space?</div>
      <div class="answer">Brains and Space is a collective of people doing cool stuff. We are engineers, designers, artists, writers, and dreamers. Brains and Space is an embodiment of our Golden Path. See more at <a target="_blank" href="../index.html">our website</a>.</div>
    </div>

    <div class='question-answer'>
      <div class="question">What's the point?</div>
      <div class="answer">"What the devil is the point of surviving, going on living, when it's a drag? But you see, that's what people do." - Alan Watts. <a href="readme/dearReader.html">Read more about the concept here.</a></div>
